# Getting Started with Gulp – Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Getting Started with Gulp – Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/getting-started-gulp-–-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787283732), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book is a hands-on guide to get you up-to-speed with Gulp. You will quickly learn how to install, configure, and run your own build system. It will empower you to automate several common development tasks to vastly improve your development workflow. This book first demonstrates various Gulp use cases before running through the process of configuring, running, and customizing Gulp, and providing you with the core concepts of Gulp, Node.js, and npm.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
var gulp = require('gulp');
var concat = require('gulp-concat');
var myth = require('gulp-myth');
```

To follow along with this book, you will need to have a computer running macOS, Linux, or
Windows and a code editor such as Atom or Sublime Text. You should also have a basic
understanding of how to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This book will
build on top of those skills and teach you ways to use them to improve your development
workflow.
